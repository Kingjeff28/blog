     <div class="post-content">
       <p>When Jeffrey told me that he was wanting to become a
       website developer, I was all for it. I myself always wanted to learn
     how to make apps. I just didn't know where to start. One thing about my
   husband is that when he sets a goal he does everything in his power
 to reach it. We both encourage eachoher and push eachother to
work hard. I am in awe of his daily progress that he makes toward reaching
 his goal. </p>
       <p> After I introduced him to the <a href="https://getmimo.com"> mimo</a>
         app, he fell in love with it instantly. I am amazed to see that in
         just a matter two weeks, he's learned to create blogs from scratch.

<h3 class="post-title">My journey to becoming a web designer.</h3> </div>
<dpiv class="post-content">
  <p> A few weeks ago, I was sitting at home thinking of ways that
    I can learn new skills without having to pay lots of money in tuition
    fees and without having to worry about being in debt for the rest of
     my life. While surfing the web I stumbled across an ad that said
      <em>"Start your own business." </em> As I began to read the ad in detail,
      the wheels in my head began to turn. I began to look at the world
     differently. I realized that everything in this world is becoming
      more and more technology driven. I realized that if I wanted to
      be successful, I mean <strong>really successful</strong>, then I should keep up
      with the current trend. Everyone is buying the latest tech gadgets.
      Or the latest tech savvy phone or car. There are millions of people
      around the world whose daily routine consists of using technology
     for more than half their day. More and more people are starting to
     invest their money into tech companies. So I asked myself, "Jeff,
     whats stopping you from developing then next big app?" "What's
     stopping you from owning your own tech company?"
     <em> <strong> NOTHING!</strong> </em> The only
     thing that can stop me is me. And I can't, won't and ain't going to
     let that happen. My total focus is centered around becoming
      the greatest web developers to ever live.
     </p>
     <p> Shortly after making up my mind anout becoming a web developer,
     my wife found an app called <a href="http://getmimo.com"> MIM0. </a>
     This app is amazing! This app helped a novice like me
      establish the fundimentals of web developing. </p>
